Installation of Dependencies
=============================

Depending on where you are installing dependencies:

In development::

    $ pip install -r requirements/local.txt

For production::

    $ pip install -r requirements.txt

*note: We install production requirements this way because many Platforms as a
Services expect a requirements.txt file in the root of projects.*
